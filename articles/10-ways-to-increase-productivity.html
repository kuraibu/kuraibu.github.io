            <h2>10 Ways To Increase Your Productivity</h2>
            <p class="meta">by <a href="../author/clive/index.html">Clive Tshuma</a> -<time datetime="08-05-2018">August 05th, 2018</time></p>
            <p>
                    Web and software development is, at least on paper, quite a straight forward job.
                    <br><br>
                    Make plan, learn syntax, write code, get results…
                    <br><br>
                    Ok, maybe that’s a bit too much of an over simplification, but you get the gist of it.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Don't Over Plan</h3>
                        <p>Over-plan? Is that even a thing?<br><br> 
                            Erm... Yes it is. Very much so.<br><br>

                            Planning out everything in detail in one chunk can often be rather over-whelming 
                            and counter productive. We often end up demotivated and unable to complete
                            all of our required tasks.

                            Leave room for flexibility. You may find some tasks require more time than initially expected 
                            and some tasks are much more simple. If your plan is too rigid this may throw you off course.
                                </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Don't Under Plan</h3>
                        <p>
                            You also shouldn't just jump in to a project without any proper thought.
                            There are questions that you need to ask about the project you are about to begin
                            before you jump into it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <h3>Pick The Right Tools</h3>
                            <p>

                            <h3>Close Unnecessary Tabs</h3>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so this one doesn't just apply to browser tabs. Often we like to try and  
                            </p>

                    <li>
                            <h3>Don't Re-Invent the Wheel</h3>
                            <p>
                                At times, you may find that you have bits of code that you reuse
                                all the time in your work. There is no reason to start from scratch evrytime you use the same piece of code.
                                <br><br> 
                                Get in the habit of keeping a library of code snippets. Over time you will notice your development
                                process getting a lot faster.
                            </p>

                    <li><h3>Ask For Help</h3>
                        <p>
                            There is an amazing community of designers on the internet. If you get stuck on any piece of code,
                            just find yourself online and pose a question to the community on stackoverflow or github forums (or whereever else...) 
                            and there is sure to be someone that can help you solve your problem.

                        <h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
                        <p>Web technologies are ever evolving and if you do not take the 
                                time as a developer to hone your skills, you will soon find 
                                yourself trailing behind.
                                <br><br>
                                Take the time to learn new technologies and even new ways of doing
                                 things in the technologies you already use. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 Aim to end every day being better than you were yesterday.

                                When driving long distances you may want to break your journey into chunks 
                                so that you don't get tired and become a danger to yourself and other drivers.
                                <br><br>
                                Likewise, it is best not to work on a project for a prolonged period of time without stopping.
                                You risk mental fatigue and thus put the success of your project in jeopardy.
                                <br><br>
                                Working in short bursts of around 20 minutes and then taking a 10 minute* break allows you space to 
                                refresh your mind and stretch your muscles. When you return to your work you will be able to
                                work at full capacity and make better choices because you are approaching the project with a fresh mind.
