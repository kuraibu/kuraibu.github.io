                <p>
                        Web and software development is, at least on paper, quite a straight forward job.
                        <br><br>
                        Make plan, learn syntax, write code, get results…
                        <br><br>
                        Ok, maybe that’s a bit too much of an over simplification, but you get the gist of it.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Don't Over Plan</h3>
                            <p>
                                So, I mentioned over-planning first because it is probably the easiest 
                                trap anyone in web design and development can fall into. I know I myself (and probably many of you) 
                                have fallen victim to over-planning on a number of occasions. There is the common 
                                misconception that the more we plan the better the implementation will be, so plan plan plan. 
                                Sometimes, planning becomes a sort of comfort zone and getting out of that comfort zone becomes a serious 
                                challenge.<br><br>

                                Often over-planning is caused by fear. Fear that your idea may not be received well. 
                                In reality, we all know how absurd this is. The one thing worse than our ideas not being 
                                received well, is our ideas not being received at all. So measures need to be taken to 
                                help us break out of our comfort zone.<br><br>

                                Before you start planning any much else. Set a date for implementation. I know this might sound 
                                unrealistic to many. How can we set deadlines if we don’t even know how we are going to approach 
                                the project. <br><br>

                                The fact that you have set a deadline doesn’t mean you have to finish everything on that date. 
                                Make practical (non-planning) steps in time for your deadline. If you need more time for 
                                further steps you can always make more implementation deadlines for the extra steps.  Setting 
                                time for yourself were you have to take actual, non-planning steps towards your goal makes your 
                                dream a reality and pulls you from the realm of perpetual planning.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>                        <h3>Don't Under Plan</h3>

                            <p>
                                The first point may have caused some misunderstandings so I am going to go right ahead and try 
                                to clear those up right now.<br><br>

                                I’ll get right to the point. Going into a project without a clear adequate plan is toxic for 
                                your project.<br><br>

                                Yes, I did encourage people to set implementation deadlines early. That is only to ensure that
                                you are going to take some practical active steps by a particular time. And remember, that was 
                                meant for those that have trouble getting started because they cannot move forward from the 
                                planning stage.<br><br>

                                Now for those of you that just like to jump straight into things (this also includes me sometimes). 
                                There are a number of problems that arise from not planning properly before starting. <br><br>

                                One of those problems is the fact that it is difficult to document when you wish to reach particular
                                milestones in your project if you haven’t put any thought into the route you would like to take to 
                                get to your end goal.<br><br>

                                Without proper planning even the end goal itself may not be that clear. Having a clear idea of what 
                                our end goal is, what it means, who it is for, and who it is not for, are all parts of the planning phase.

                                Every web professional should have a set of questions that as a minimum should be answered before undertaking 
                                any web project. That way, there is a sense of clarity and direction from the very moment you start a web project. <br><br>

                                If you do not have any such questions I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/business-articles/15-must-ask-questions-when-taking-on-a-website-project/">
                                    this</a> article I read from Design Shack. 
                                I think this is a great starting point for anyone.<br><br>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>Pick The Right Tools</h3>
                                <p>
                                        Okay, so the tool doesn’t make the web developer. However, tools are there to 
                                        make the web developers job easier.<br><br>

                                        There is more pressure now than ever before on web professionals to produce 
                                        results in a fraction of the time they used to without compromising on the 
                                        quality of the work. Picking the right tools is an important step to that end.<br><br>

                                        I recently started using Visual Studio Code. It’s a very fully featured lightweight IDE 
                                        from Microsoft. I know, lightweight and fully featured don’t normally go together.<br><br>

                                        I like VSCode so much because  it comes with the capability to download extensions to make 
                                        working with whatever program you are working with much easier. It also comes with a built 
                                        in command line interface, which works great for me as I like to use git and install some of 
                                        my extensions using command line.<br><br>

                                        While I would highly recommend using VSCode to anyone, I encourage you all to try different 
                                        tools out for yourselves. If the tool is not right for you then discard it and exchange it 
                                        for one that fits into your workflow better.<br><br>
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>Close Unnecessary Tabs</h3>
                                <p>
                                        This one is a problem for great many people. It’s so easy to end up with way too many browser 
                                        tabs open. There is that video you need to watch on youtube, those articles you need to read, 
                                        your research sources, online catalogues, social media… it goes on and on.<br><br>

                                        Stop!<br><br>

                                        This is precisely why bookmarking exists. Chances are, you are not going to actually get back 
                                        to any of those browser tabs any time soon. It can all get very overwhelming and stressful. <br><br>

                                        The more clutter we have around us the busier we feel. This applies in life and on your browser. 
                                        There is simply not enough time in the day to get through everything all at once.<br><br>

                                        Take the time to organise what you really need and bookmark it for later. If it’s really that important
                                        you can even set reminders for yourself to go back to it. But, if it stays in-front of you open then 
                                        it is just another thing that you need to do that you don’t really have the time for. Either that or 
                                        it will end up taking up time you should be using for something else.<br><br>

                                        Either way, having too many browser tabs open is just a fast track way to stressing about how very busy you are.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>Don't Re-Invent the Wheel</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Often in development we find ourselves having to repeat the same piece of code again and again.<br><br>

                                    Using code snippets saves time for the obvious reason that typing 6 words is faster than typing 20. However,
                                    it also saves you time because retyping entire bits of code leave you at risk of making human errors. 
                                    A simple typo gone unnoticed could be the disastrous to your project and very time consuming. <br><br>

                                    Using an editor that makes it easy to create and use your own snippets is the an amazing way to shave 
                                    production time and free up time for other parts of your project.<br><br>

                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Ask For Help</h3>
                            <p>
                            If you get stuck on a problem, yes you could find the answer in a book somewhere, or you could spend hours and 
                            hours trying to wreck your brain over what could have possibly gone wrong. I find the best way to deal with it 
                            is to ask for help.<br><br>

                            There is a vast and amazing community of talented web professionals online. If you don’t have the solution to 
                            your problem I assure you, someone else probably does, or if not, someone has the knowledge to point you in the 
                            right direction.<br><br>

                            As well as asking for help, it is great to also give back to the community. If you have a moment, take time to 
                            answer a question another web professional such as yourself might have. Helping other people is also another good 
                            way to keep that knowledge fresh in your brain.<br><br>
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
                            <p>
                                So someone told me that, “If you don’t enjoy learning new things, you have no business going into web development”. 
                                This statement couldn’t be more true. <br><br>

                                Web technologies are changing all the time and it is important for you to keep up. This doesn’t mean that you now 
                                need to be an expert on every web technology that hits the market; but you need to at the very least learn enough 
                                to keep yourself competitive in your field and niche.<br><br>

                                Luckily for us there are so many routes that we can take towards learning web technologies. Some are paid and some 
                                completely free. It’s just a matter of knowing what it is you want to learn and where you can most likely find it.<br><br>

                                Websites like Codecademy, Khan Academy, and Free Code Camp are great resources for gaining extra knowledge in web 
                                development and what’s best about those is that they are FREE!<br><br>

                                Ofcourse, there are other free and paid choices for you to consider. Just search for what you want to learn online 
                                and stay informed.<br><br>

                                <p>
                                    One of the many problems that web professionals face is that they often forget they are human. By that I mean 
                                    I have met many that would attempt to work for hours and hours with no rest whatsoever. I myself have tried that.<br><br>

                                    However, this is not at all good for our productivity. We might fool ourselves into believing that this is the 
                                    best way to get our work done but that simply is not the case.<br><br>

                                    I recommend working in for shorter periods of time were you only focus on one task avoiding any distractions. 
                                    Set goals for each sprint and at the end, take a break. RELAX. Take your hands away from the keyboard. Better yet, 
                                    just walk away from your computer (Or whatever it is that you were doing).<br><br>

                                    Before you start the next sprint make sure you are clear on what the goals for that sprint are and prepare the any 
                                    tools you may need. Your next sprint should be just as productive as the previous one.<br><br>

                        <li>
                                <h3>Rest</h3>
                                <p> 
                                    So you have already been advised to take breaks but the importance of rest is something that so many of us take 
                                    for granted. Some even believe that proper makes rest makes you lazy. That is why it gets its own special mention 
                                    in this article.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rest is not only important for our overall health, it is also arguably essential for optimum productivity. 
                                    Proper rest allows us to think more clearly and thus allowing us to do our work more effectively.<br><br>

                                    45 minutes of work while well rested, refreshed, thinking clearly and focusing well is better than 2 hours 
                                    of work on a tired, sluggish brain that lacks the ability to even focus on the work at hand let alone solve 
                                        complex problems that arise during your project.<br><br>
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>Create Guides</h3>
                                <p>
                                        I mention this last but it is certainly not least in this list. When writing large amounts of code one of the most 
                                        difficult things is to remain consistent throughout your code. One way to maintain consistency is to use guides.<br><br>
                                        
                                        A web designer or developer can add a set of predesigned elements to the project and a set of rules and guidelines to 
                                        be followed so that all the different parts of the website remain consistent.<br><br>

                                        This is great for large projects that you may be working on or when multiple professionals are working on the same project.<br><br>
