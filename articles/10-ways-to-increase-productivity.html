            <h2>10 Ways To Increase Your Productivity</h2>
            <p class="meta">by <a href="../author/clive/index.html">Clive Tshuma</a> -<time datetime="08-05-2018">August 05th, 2018</time></p>
            <p>
                    Web and software development is, at least on paper, quite a straight forward job.
                    <br><br>
                    Make plan, learn syntax, write code, get results…
                    <br><br>
                    Ok, maybe that’s a bit too much of an over simplification, but you get the gist of it.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Don't Over Plan</h3>
                        <p>
                            So, I mentioned over-planning first because it is probably the easiest 
                            trap anyone in web design and development can fall into. I know I myself (and probably many of you) 
                            have fallen victim to over-planning on a number of occasions. There is the common 
                            misconception that the more we plan the better the implementation will be, so plan plan plan. 
                            Sometimes, planning becomes a sort of comfort zone and getting out of that comfort zone becomes a serious 
                            challenge.<br><br>

                            Often over-planning is caused by fear. Fear that your idea may not be received well. 
                            In reality, we all know how absurd this is. The one thing worse than our ideas not being 
                            received well, is our ideas not being received at all. So measures need to be taken to 
                            help us break out of our comfort zone.<br><br>

                            Before you start planning any much else. Set a date for implementation. I know this might sound 
                            unrealistic to many. How can we set deadlines if we don’t even know how we are going to approach 
                            the project. <br><br>

                            The fact that you have set a deadline doesn’t mean you have to finish everything on that date. 
                            Make practical (non-planning) steps in time for your deadline. If you need more time for 
                            further steps you can always make more implementation deadlines for the extra steps.  Setting 
                            time for yourself were you have to take actual, non-planning steps towards your goal makes your 
                            dream a reality and pulls you from the realm of perpetual planning.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>                        <h3>Don't Under Plan</h3>

                        <p>
                            The first point may have caused some misunderstandings so I am going to go right ahead and try 
                            to clear those up right now.<br><br>

                            I’ll get right to the point. Going into a project without a clear adequate plan is toxic for 
                            your project.<br><br>

                            Yes, I did encourage people to set implementation deadlines early. That is only to ensure that
                             you are going to take some practical active steps by a particular time. And remember, that was 
                             meant for those that have trouble getting started because they cannot move forward from the 
                             planning stage.<br><br>

                             Now for those of you that just like to jump straight into things (this also includes me sometimes). 
                             There are a number of problems that arise from not planning properly before starting. <br><br>

                             One of those problems is the fact that it is difficult to document when you wish to reach particular
                              milestones in your project if you haven’t put any thought into the route you would like to take to 
                              get to your end goal.<br><br>

                              Without proper planning even the end goal itself may not be that clear. Having a clear idea of what 
                              our end goal is, what it means, who it is for, and who it is not for, are all parts of the planning phase.

                              Every web professional should have a set of questions that as a minimum should be answered before undertaking 
                              any web project. That way, there is a sense of clarity and direction from the very moment you start a web project. <br><br>

                              If you do not have any such questions I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/business-articles/15-must-ask-questions-when-taking-on-a-website-project/">
                                this</a> article I read from Design Shack. 
                              I think this is a great starting point for anyone.<br><br>

                            <h3>Pick The Right Tools</h3>
                            <p>
                                You also shouldn't just jump in to a project without any proper thought.
                                There are questions that you need to ask about the project you are about to begin
                                before you jump into it.
                            </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <h3>Close Unnecessary Tabs</h3>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so this one doesn't just apply to browser tabs. Often we like to try and  
                            </p>

                    <li>
                            <h3>Don't Re-Invent the Wheel</h3>
                            <p>
                                At times, you may find that you have bits of code that you reuse
                                all the time in your work. There is no reason to start from scratch evrytime you use the same piece of code.
                                <br><br> 
                                Get in the habit of keeping a library of code snippets. Over time you will notice your development
                                process getting a lot faster.
                            </p>

                    <li><h3>Ask For Help</h3>
                        <p>
                            There is an amazing community of designers on the internet. If you get stuck on any piece of code,
                            just find yourself online and pose a question to the community on stackoverflow or github forums (or whereever else...) 
                            and there is sure to be someone that can help you solve your problem.

                        <h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
                        <p>Web technologies are ever evolving and if you do not take the 
                                time as a developer to hone your skills, you will soon find 
                                yourself trailing behind.
                                <br><br>
                                Take the time to learn new technologies and even new ways of doing
                                 things in the technologies you already use. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 Aim to end every day being better than you were yesterday.
                            </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <h3>Work In Sprints</h3>
                            <p>
                                When driving long distances you may want to break your journey into chunks 
                                so that you don't get tired and become a danger to yourself and other drivers.
                                <br><br>
                                Likewise, it is best not to work on a project for a prolonged period of time without stopping.
                                You risk mental fatigue and thus put the success of your project in jeopardy.
                                <br><br>
                                Working in short bursts of around 20 minutes and then taking a 10 minute* break allows you space to 
                                refresh your mind and stretch your muscles. When you return to your work you will be able to
                                work at full capacity and make better choices because you are approaching the project with a fresh mind.
